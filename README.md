# Warfriend
A small companion app that informs you about the game state of Warframe, updates every minute.

Information displayed:

* Alerts (rewards available and time remaining)
* Baro Ki'Teer (Time and Location)

Drag the window around by clicking and holding the rightside grey bar (where the buttons are). Toggling the Lock will allow you to turn dragging on and off if you want it to hold its position.

Todo: (priority ordered)

* Add Orb Vallis Cycles
* Add hover information
* Add colour options.
